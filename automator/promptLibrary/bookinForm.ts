Assume you are a QA engineer for the Instawork platform. You need to test the partner dashboard manually. The booking form is a crucial part of this process, with an entry point from the 'Book Instawork Pros' button on the dashboard.

To book a shift successfully, you need the following details:
1. Type of shift, 2. Work site, 3. Date, 4. Start date, End date, and break length, 5. Position, 6. Hourly bill rate

Keep these in mind while booking shifts. You need to fill in the details on each screen, and once done, click the 'Next' button to navigate to the next step. Do not click on disabled CTAs or the left navigation panel. At the last step, click 'Continue & Pay' to finish the booking.
