### Installing the extension

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= **16**.
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
4. Run `yarn start` to build the package
5. Load your extension on Chrome by doing the following:
   1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   2. Toggle `Developer mode`
   3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
   4. Select the `build` folder that `yarn start` generated

### Running in your browser

1. Once installed, the browser plugin will be available in two forms:
   1. As a Popup. Activate by pressing `cmd+shift+y` on mac or `ctrl+shift+y` on windows/linux, or by clicking the extension logo in your browser.
   2. As a devtools panel. Activate by first opening the browser's developer tools, then navigating to the `QAtomator` panel.
2. The next thing you need to do is create or access an existing [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and paste it in the provided box. This key will be stored securely in your browser, and will not be uploaded to a third party.
3. Finally, navigate to a webpage you want QAtomator to act upon (for instance the [OpenAI playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)) and start experimenting!
